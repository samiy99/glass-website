part of a tutorial from dev ed
i have been away from web dev for some time

this was mostly to test if i still remember basic fundamentals

if you are interested in testing your self you should head up to dev ed's channel he is really awesome

also new to github i know this is not what is supposed to be on the readme part of the repository
